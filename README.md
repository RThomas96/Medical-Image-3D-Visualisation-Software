# Medical Image Visualizer

*N.B.* : This project is the result of the work done for the end of my Masters degree for the year 2019/2020. You can find the original project proposal [here](http://www.lirmm.fr/~nfaraj/files/positions/sujet_stage-prostate3D.pdf).

----

This project aims to provide an easy way to visualize high-resolution medical images.

You can load and visualize TIFF, OME-TIFF and DIM/IMA images in real-time. You can choose from a variety of color scales to apply to all or a part of the displayed values on screen.

Some screen captures will be coming soon.
