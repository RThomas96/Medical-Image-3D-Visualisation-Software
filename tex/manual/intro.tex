\section{What is the goal of the project ?}\label{text:01_intro:00_project}
{
	% Why was the project started ?
	This project's overarching goal is to provide a set of software tools to manage, process and visualize high-resolution medical images.\par
	It started out with analysis of prostate cancer tissue as its main \guillemotleft~target~\guillemotright~, however as time went on it was also used to visualize images of mice brain in collaboration with the IGF\footnote{\textit{Institut de GÃ©nomique Fonctionnelle},~\href{https://www.igf.cnrs.fr/index.php/en/}{\underline{\textit{website}}}~}.

	\vspace{\baselineskip}

	% Why tho ?
	In the original context of the project, the images to manage, process and visualize would have been acquired using a \textit{di-SPIM} microscope. This microscope is a light-sheet microscope which uses two camera modules in order to counter the most prevalent caveat in light-sheet microscopy : anisotropy. As such, it produces two stacks of images defined in two different affine spaces which need to be processed as a single stack of images down the line.\par
	This additional deformation constraint meant no existing software solutions would be able to handle our data out-of-the-box, so we had to roll out our own. And, over the course of one Master's internship and a 10 month engineering employment contract, a first draft of such a software package has been created.

	% Alright. What are the caveats ?
	However, it has to be made abundantly clear that whoever picks up this project down the line must not feel obligated to go down the same path taken here. Some bad design decisions might have been made due to a lack of foresight, or simply due to a lack of knowledge about the task of creating such a piece of software.

	% What's the deal, man ? Give us the deets.
	%% Over the course of this manual, you will learn about the work done over the last year, the work to do and the specifics of the software solution deployed here.

\section{What are the main goals of the program ?}\label{text:01_intro:01_goals}
{
	% Why was the program created, what does it do ?

	The current software solution was first created during the internship, titled "Visualization, management and processing of high-resolution medical images". This internship was done while studying at the University of Montpellier. It was then continued during the engineering position in 2020/2021. This is the result of those few months of work.

	% Original goal : load image, store it in memory and re-sample it in high res.
	Its original goal (during the internship) was to provide a simple way to generate high-resolution medical images, outside of the affine space mentionned earlier. To this goal, it had to load a 3D image, downsampled enough to fit within the GPU's memory budget and deform it in order to visualize the resulting image interactively. It then had to allow the user to re-sample a part of the image, and save it to disk for later processing.

	% Additional goal : visualize it in 3D
	% Engineering : implement a volumetric visualization method (first experimented during intership)
	% Engineering : do the same generation, but offline
	% Tasks that can be done : visualize, deform (dumb uninteractive way), resample

	While those tasks were implemented at the end of my internship, we later more features in the following engineering position. We added a real-time volumetric visualization method, allowing to see the sample in three-dimensions interactively. We also added the ability to load grids that would not fit within the memory budget, and downsample them on the fly at loading time in order to visualize bigger acquisitions. We also added the ability to generate the sub-parts of the image in an \guillemotleft~out-of-core~\guillemotright fashion, meaning it does not need to store neither the source image(s) or the resulting image(s) in memory, doing the processing directly from and to the disk.

\section{How to read this manual ?}\label{text:01_intro:02_howtoread}
{
	% How to read the manual : in any way you see fit.
	% Chapters have a main purpose, but can be read independently.
	% Manual is for everyone on the project, but some parts for software devs only

	% TODO : add the references to the pipeline and code chapters here
	While chapters \ref{text:01_intro}\footnotemark and \ref{text:01_intro}\footnotemark will be more oriented towards the developers, the more curious users can peruse those parts of the manual in order to gain a better understanding of the inner workings of the code underneath.
	\footnotetext{TODO: change the references to the pipeline and code chapters of this manual.}

	A small note for the developers : this code was made heavily re-done between the internship and the engineering contract to simplify the development of new features, but some parts of it are still a work-in-progress (they will be designated as such in here). If you feel the need to refactor or change large parts of the codebase in order to either specialize or generalize a certain block of code, you're welcome to do it. However, I'd ask you update this documentation to mirror those changes.

\section{Glossary}\label{text:01_intro:03_definitions}
{
	For the sake of clarity, here are a few definitions of the words used within this manual, in no particular order :

	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{dataset} : this can be used to design one or multiple images that make up an acquisition
	\end{itemize}
